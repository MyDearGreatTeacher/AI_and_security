1. Signing up for the SWAMP or accessing it via them github,Google, or InCommon credentials.
2. Uploading software to the SWAMP.
3. Running a variety of software assurance tools.
4. Viewing and interpreting the results.
5. Fixing problems found and iterating over the above steps

The goals for this tutorial are to teach software developers and designers to:
• Visualize code and software design from a security perspective.
• Learn specific techniques for writing secure code.
• Learn how software assurance tools can to help improve the security of their code.
• Learn about specific tools resources available to them and get initial experience using these resources.
